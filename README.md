# Packing List

You're taking a trip for New Year's Eve, and you'll need a packing list to make sure you don't forget anything before you depart on your journey! 

## MVP
Your MVP is to create an application that:
* displays a list of all items pack
* takes in user input to add a new item to pack
* updates to display the new item in the list 

## The API
Follow the instructions in the README to run [this packing list API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/packing-list-api) locally. You'll need to have this one running while you're working. 

## HTML && CSS

You have been given a basic (boring) HTML and CSS layout to work with (plus some JS to get the modal showing up). Before building out this app, decide how much you want to work on HTML and CSS with this project. 
* **LOTS** - Totally ignore this starter repo and make your own from scratch!!
* **SOME** - Fork this repo, and edit the HTML and CSS given to you. Add some flair however you see fit!
* **NONE** - All good, just use this HTML and CSS as is!

_Hmmm what is that ":root" thing in the CSS?_

 ## Other Considerations
 
This is the LAST DAY of your advent calendar! I strongly encourage you to reflect on the past two weeks, and think about what you feel like you still need some extra practice with. See how you can get in that practice with this project :) 

## BONUS
* Anything you can think off! Add an additional feature, experiment with an NPM package of your choosing, focus on writing tests for this, make it responsive, add some animations. You're in charge!
* There's a DELETE method in the API you're using. Is there a way you could use this to get rid of an item once its packed? You'll need to make this clear on the user interface.
